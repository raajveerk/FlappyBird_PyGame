# Flappy Bird by Raajveer

Sooo, this is Flappy Bird, the most-difficult-game-in-the-world that I made using Python's "pygame" module.

Try it out for yourself: https://www.pygame.org/news


### Installation

To play this wonderful little game yourself, start by cloning this repository.

```commandline
git clone _URL_
```

Then, either you could run the following command in your terminal:

```commandline
python app.py
```

OR, you could directly launch the executable 'app.exe' file that I've uploaded in the repository :P

Either way you're gonna have too much fun :D


## Happy Coding!
